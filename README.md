Syslog4j provides client and server implementations of the BSD Syslog protocol
(RFC 3164) and the draft "structured syslog" protocol (RFC Draft).

## Warning

This is a repackaged fork used in [Graylog2](http://graylog2.org/), as the
original package has no recent versions published to Maven Central.

Some modifications have been applied to fix bugs we ran into.
